<h1>Getting to Know Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Jennie Guzman! I am in college and majoring in Animation and Motion Graphics. My goal is to become an animator and bring my drawings and ideas to life. I've had a passion for drawing and anything art related since I was a toddler. Creating various things from my imagination, many characters with their own stories. In the future, I plan on creating a story with the characters I have created and animating it. I am supported by many and it encourages me further to pursue my dreams. Thank you very much for visiting my website and I hope to see again! </p>
